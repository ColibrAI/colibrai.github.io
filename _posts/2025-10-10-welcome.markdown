The ColibrAI project is now getting started, and the first kick-off meeting has already taken place. The involved teams are led by <a href="https://payberah.github.io/">Amir H. Payberah</a> from KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden), <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/andrea-botero-cabrera">Andrea Botero</a> from Aalto University (Finland), and <a href="https://www.abpaed.tu-darmstadt.de/pid/arbeitsbereich_pid/team_pid/details_75904.de.jsp">Nina Grünberger</a> from TU Darmstadt (Germany). The ColibrAI project is part of Unite! University's Seed Funds programme, which brings together three teams from different international universities to combine their expertise in AI, justice, participatory design, and decolonial perspectives.

The first meeting focused on all three teams getting to know each other. In addition to the team leaders, the ColibrAI project team consists of members from varying status groups of scientific researchers. The main focus was on learning about the various disciplines and their respective approaches to AI, as well as identifying potential interdisciplinary points of contact. The teams from the project universities presented their disciplines, providing a brief introduction to their current projects and research topics, and outlined their various approaches to AI. The project plan and its various phases were then presented to address questions and establish initial agreements on the collaborative work approach in ColibrAI.

Those of us involved from the participating universities are starting the project with a positive feeling and look forward to the exciting developments in the upcoming months.
