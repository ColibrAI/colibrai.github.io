<h2 style="text-align:left;">Project Phases and Expected Outcomes</h2>
<div style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-word;">
<p><b>Phase 1: Establishing Collaboration and Knowledge Exchange</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Organization of online meetings to align expectations, define common research goals, and capture the expertise of the partners.</li>
  <li>Conduct a literature and initiative review to assess existing community-centric AI research and identify gaps, published through a collaborative and public platform.</li>
  <li>Host online sessions for knowledge exchange.</li>
  <li>Develop a public research gap report summarizing key insights from the literature review to establish a shared foundation for future work.</li>
  <li>Define a preliminary funding roadmap, identifying key grant calls and aligning research priorities for later stages.</li>
  <li>Establish a shared research repository for findings and references to facilitate collaboration (repository structure will be defined based on partner needs).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Phase 2: Research Agenda Development and Public Engagement</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Integrate discussions on participatory AI, co-liberation, and ethical AI governance into partner universities' courses through guest lectures and online discussions.</li>
  <li>Organize a one-day online workshop on participatory AI, labor rights, and decentralized decision-making, engaging researchers, civil society groups, policymakers, and industry representatives.</li>
  <li>Identify potential joint research projects and interdisciplinary synergies.</li>
  <li>Begin drafting initial research concepts, integrating knowledge exchange activities and stakeholder feedback.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Phase 3: In-Person Workshop and Research Planning</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Host a two-day in-person workshop at KTH, bringing together researchers, PhD students, and external experts to refine research directions and strengthen collaboration.</li>
  <li>Finalize at least two joint research concepts to be developed into larger grant applications.</li>
  <li>Develop small collaborative publications (e.g., blog posts, essays, or short research papers) to increase ColibrAI's visibility and attract broader participation.</li>
  <li>Produce a white paper on participatory AI governance, summarizing workshop findings and research directions intended for policy and research dissemination.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Phase 4: Proposal Development and Future Funding Strategy</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify and assess potential funding opportunities, with an emphasis on Horizon Europe, ERC, MSCA, and NordForsk grants.</li>
  <li>Draft joint research proposals, ensuring a clear division of writing responsibilities among partners.</li>
  <li>Develop a risk mitigation plan, identifying alternative funding sources (e.g., smaller grants, industry partnerships, or pilot projects).</li>
  <li>Finalize a roadmap for the continuation of ColibrAI, ensuring long-term research sustainability beyond the seed funding phase.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Expected Outcomes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Established a research network on participatory AI, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration across KTH, Aalto, and TUDa.</li>
  <li>Engaged researchers, students, and community members through online sessions, workshops, and teaching activities.</li>
  <li>Developed a formal research roadmap, integrating AI, participatory design, and decolonial perspectives.</li>
  <li>Produced blog posts and white paper on participatory AI governance to inform future research and policy discussions.</li>
  <li>Finalized joint research concepts for larger-scale funding applications.</li>
  <li>Strengthened Unite!’s research capacity in community-centric AI, establishing new academic and policy collaborations.</li>
  <li>Positioned the project for future large-scale funding, ensuring long-term sustainability.</li>
</ul>
